# Track inventory parts

General aviation businesses suffer every day from a lack of available parts, poor visibility into their own inventory, and a lack of interconnectedness between inventory systems.

This application allows mechanics, managers, and procurement specialists to easily track their own inventory, find parts from other suppliers, and link their inventories to a global network of part houses and manufacturers.
